Takeaways 
This project taught me the importance of:
- Detail-oriented work
- Trial and error
- Accessibility

Tools & Resources 
- Artwork & Visuals: My own artwork along with SVG icons
- Fonts: Google Fonts (Grandstander) to ensure readability while maintaining character
- AI Assistance: Copilot to help with coding and troubleshooting

Challenges 
The most difficult parts of this process were:
- Understanding parent-child relationships within the code
- Learning coding language 
- Correcting Grid layouts 

Final Thoughts
Overall, I am happy with how the live site turned out, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with everyone!
