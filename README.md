This is my first time building a website from scartch! This project is attempting to drive more traffic to my socal media accounts and too add some more tools in my graphic design tool box. This project tought me the importance of detail oriented work, trail and error, and assesiblity. To create this webiste I used my own artwork along with svg icons for visuals. I used Google fonts to find the right font for this project. I used Grandstander to keep the text readable while still having come character. The most difficult part for me during this process was understanding parent child relationships within the code along with learnig how to code in genral. Overall I am happy with how the live site turned out and im excited to share it with everyone.
