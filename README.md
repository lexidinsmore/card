This is my first time building a website from scartch! This project is attempting to drive more traffic to my socal media accounts and just to learn some new skills. This project tought me the importance of detail oriented work and trail and error. To create this webiste I used my own artwork along with svg icons for visuals. I used Google fonts to find the right font for this project. I used "Chelsea Market" to keep the text readable while still having come character.
